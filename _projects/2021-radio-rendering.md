For our statics class, we were asked to design a system involving 3 pins, an actuator of our choice, and a rigid bar. The goal of the design was to maximize the amount of weight the actuator could push up to the highest possible height given  restrains of a design space of 150 cm wide by 50 cm high and the requirement that atleast two pins be connected to the ground. Our design choices were focused on the choice of actuator, the placement of the actuator, where to place the weight on the bar, where to connect the bar to the actuator, and the length of the bar.

When approaching the challenge, I focused on applying the tools I gained in class, using force and moment balances to determine where to connect the actuator to the bar and where to place the weight on the bar. I initially set up my moment balance in terms of variables and then use the maximum system height of 50 cm to use real values.
